        <p>
            As a kid I was fascinated in electronics and later on I discover computer.
            I got my first computer when I was 7, back in 1993, I started to play in paint and later on I moved to Adobe Photoshop
            I was very eager to grow up and have my own money and do what I want but nobody was taken me serious because I was a kid.
        </p>

            By the time I reached 15 years, I started to organize events that help me know many people and visit many cities.
            I had this passion on a side, during my college and university and was very hard to let go.
            The ONG help out in finding my first job , as international coordinator, when I was 20.
