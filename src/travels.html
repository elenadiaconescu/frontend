    <h1>Travels</h1>

    <p>
        Since I was a kid I want to travel around the world, I felt my hometown, Bacau, was to small for me and I can do
        more.<br>
        When I was 15 years old I join a colleague organization and I start organizing events and travel trough this,
        all around Romania.<br>
        By the time I moved out from my hometown, I visited all the main cities and I was ready to take it to the next
        level.
    </p>
    <p>
        In Bucharest, I joined several organizations but my main focus was EESTEC, that help me out travel all around
        Europe. <br> Once I had a good image of each culture, and after finishing university I decided to move to Portugal.<br>
        I visited the beautiful land from south to north, east to west.
        My university was in Lisbon so I made this city my home for 4 years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Later on, I felt that my curiosity needs to be more fed so I relocated in Prague.
